# :dna: Bioinformatic's Activities
In this repository, all exercises developed in the Bioinformatics discipline are allocated.

## :microscope: First Activity

We had to write a program that transcribes a strand of DNA. You can see how I did [here](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-01)
```
Input: DNA strand.
Output: messenger RNA
````
Test using the sequence from this [file](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-01/TRANSCRICAO.sequenciasDNA.xlsx).

## :petri_dish: Second Activity

From the genetic code, we had to program a ribosome. We wrote a program that simulates a ribosome. You can see how I did [here](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-02)
```
Input: Messenger RNA strand (mRNA) and Genetic Code. 
Output: Amino acid string (text file).
```
Estimated time: 20 min.

Test using this [file](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/CodigoGenetico.txt)

## :test_tube: Third Activity (in progress)

In this activity, we had to develop a Smith-Waterman algorithm. It performs sequence alignment. It determines similar regions between two sequences of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences.
