# :dna: Bioinformatic's Activities
In this repository, all exercises developed in the Bioinformatics discipline are allocated.

## :microscope: First Activity

We had to write a program that transcribes a strand of DNA. You can see how I did [here](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-01/main.py)
```
Input: DNA strand.
Output: messenger RNA
````
Test using the sequence from this [file](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-01/TRANSCRICAO.sequenciasDNA.xlsx).
