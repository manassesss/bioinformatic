# :dna: Bioinformatic's Activities
In this repository, all exercises developed in the Bioinformatics discipline are allocated.

## :microscope: First Activity

We had to write a program that transcribes a strand of DNA. You can see how I did [here](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-01)
```
Input: DNA strand.
Output: messenger RNA
````
Test using the sequence from this [file](https://github.com/manassesss/bioinformatic/blob/main/Activity-01/TRANSCRICAO.sequenciasDNA.xlsx).

## :petri_dish: Second Activity

From the genetic code, program a ribosome. Write a program that simulates a ribosome. You can see how I did [here]()
```
Input: Messenger RNA strand (mRNA) and Genetic Code. 
Output: Amino acid string (text file).
```
Estimated time: 20 min.
